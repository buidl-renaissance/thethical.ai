# ✨ Core Feature: Smart Content-to-Workflow Engine
The platform centers around a simple but powerful interaction:
Users take a photo, speak a note, and the system analyzes both to kickstart a personalized workflow.

## 🖼️ Photo + Voice Input
Users capture a moment—an idea, a product, a workspace, etc.—with a photo and attach a voice note describing their intent.

## 🧠 AI Analysis
The system processes the image and transcribes the voice input, using both to understand context, goals, and category.

## 🗂️ Template Matching
Based on the content, a relevant workflow template is automatically suggested (e.g., project planning, marketing campaign, event setup, portfolio item).

## 🛠️ Workflow Generation
The selected template populates a tailored workflow with suggested next steps, tools, and resources.
